Title: Feature-Based Landscape Analysis of Continuous and Constraint
    Optimization Problems
Description: Contains tools and features, which can be used for an Exploratory
    Landscape Analysis (ELA) of single-objective continuous optimization problems.
    Those features are able to quantify rather complex properties, such as the
    global structure, separability, etc., of the optimization problems.
